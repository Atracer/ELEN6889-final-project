<span class="s1">message = </span><span class="s4">&quot;&quot;&quot; 
As of JAX 0.4.0, JAX only supports TPU VMs, not the older Colab TPUs. 
 
We recommend trying Kaggle Notebooks 
(https://www.kaggle.com/code, click on &quot;New Notebook&quot; near the top) which offer 
TPU VMs. You have to create an account, log in, and verify your account to get 
accelerator support. 
Once you do that, there's a new &quot;TPU 1VM v3-8&quot; accelerator option. This gives 
you a TPU notebook environment similar to Colab, but using the newer TPU VM 
architecture. This should be a less buggy, more performant, and overall better 
experience than the older TPU node architecture. 
 
It is also possible to use Colab together with a self-hosted Jupyter kernel 
running on a Cloud TPU VM. See 
https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html 
for details.
